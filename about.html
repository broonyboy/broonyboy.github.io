        <p>Well, were do i start?  The Broons are a bit of a mixed bunch. The wider family is spread out around the globe, but at the moment my immediate family is in the North East of England, namely Blyth in the County of Northumberland and Newcastle, just down the road in Tyne and Wear.  I have been married for 26 years to my lovely wife Susan and have two children Andrew and Jack.</p>
        <p class="dark">My Sons other halfs (only 1 official daughter-in-law) at the moment, are Gemma and Steff.  In October 2014 Andrew and Gemma became the proud parents of our favourite (so far) Grandaughter Georgia. She is absolutely Gorgious and it is my wish that I can forge a fantastic relationship with her and pass down some of my likes and skills, helping her on into the scarey future.</p>
        <p>So this brings me back to the purpose of this website.  It is a place where I shall practice what I can on web development and any other skill that requires web hosting.  As you can see at the moment this is a free hosted site and this I presume will bring along limitations, but I will go as far as I can and then maybe stump up for a hosting package - let's see how it goes.</p>

          <h3>Where we live.</h3>
          <p>We have been lucky enough to live in a lovely area of Blyth which is a coastal town in the North East of England, in the County of Northumberland.  Blyth has a proud sea faring history, with boats being built on the river for years (the original Ark Royal was built in Blyth).  During the Second World war Blyth was a submarine base and the Light Batteries still exist and can be visited.
